# Legacy Sheet Template Project Guidelines

These rules must be followed at all times when making changes to this project:

1. Just do what you're asked, nothing more, nothing less.
2. Do not edit/remove any of the existing functionality/features/UI elements unless asked.
3. Follow the design that we have throughout the project.
4. It is important for us to not to break the project by introducing changes that mess up the whole project.
5. Do not mess up the current state of project.
6. When writing CSS for element -- the css code for that element should exist in the style.css file and not in the main.js file.
7. Add one liner comments over the changes/improvements you add on the in existing codebase.

## Project Structure

The main project structure:
- [src/main.js](mdc:src/main.js) - Core application logic
- [data/](mdc:data) - Contains data files used by the application
- [public/](mdc:public) - Static assets for the application
- [scripts/](mdc:scripts) - Utility scripts
- [vite.config.js](mdc:vite.config.js) - Build configuration
