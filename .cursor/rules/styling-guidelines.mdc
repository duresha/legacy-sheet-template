# Styling Guidelines

## CSS Organization

All styling for the application is contained in [src/style.css](mdc:src/style.css). This file includes:

- Font imports and definitions
- Layout structure (panels, containers)
- Component-specific styling
- Responsive design rules
- Print media queries

## Important Style Rules

1. **All CSS must be added to style.css**, not inline or in main.js
2. Follow the existing naming conventions:
   - Use kebab-case for class names (e.g., `person-entry`, `generation-title`)
   - Component containers use `-container` suffix
   - Interactive elements have their state in the class name (e.g., `button-success`)
3. Maintain the existing color scheme:
   - Primary green: `#2f3d22`, `#3a4d2a`
   - Background: `#f5f5f5`, `#f0f0f0` 
   - Text colors: `#333`, `#444`
4. Follow existing responsive breakpoints:
   - Desktop: Default
   - Medium: `@media screen and (max-width: 1200px)`
   - Small: `@media screen and (max-width: 600px)`
   - Print: `@media print`

## Print Styling

The print styling is critical for PDF generation. When adding new elements, ensure they are properly styled for print by:

1. Making them visible in print mode if they should appear in the PDF
2. Adding them to the print exclusion list if they should not appear in the PDF
3. Testing print preview to verify correct appearance
